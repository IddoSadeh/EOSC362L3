lab 3 sketch

## Sketching your interpretation of chronostratigraphy on geologic sections

**Instructions**. Complete these tasks only when instructions in the lab manual tell you to.

 1. Use "add text to image" button to add **your name** to the top left corner (follow directions under image when "text" button is selected).
 2. Use the "Color Picker" button to change the text color of your name (eg blue).
 3. Use "text" button to add abbreviations for **Location Ages** in the boxes. Two are done for you as examples.
 4. Use "Draw" buttons to draw your interpretation of **boundaries between named ages**. 
     1. These are "chronostratigraphic lines".
     2. They should span all three geological columns indicating the boundaries between rocks of distinct ages, for example the boundary between Ordovician and Silurian rocks.
 5. Use the "Color Picker" button to pick a different color for your drawing (eg red).
 6. **For Specimen #47**: Also mark one or more locations with an "X" and label it (or them) with "S47" to indicate where in these geological sections you think specimen #47 could have fallen from.
 7. **Save result** as you did for Lab 1:
    a. Click camera icon (in tool bar). This saves your image.
    c. PLEASE name this file using your name: eg. "JaneDoe.png". Do NOT change the "png" part.
 8. Finally, upload your image to the Course CONNECT site using the link "Lab 3 step 4; save your sketch here".

Once you have saved your image WITH FILE NAME AS INSTRUCTED ABOVE, you are done!
